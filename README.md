# Chest X-Ray Medical Images Classification

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify chest X-ray images using machine learning techniques to assist in the detection of various lung diseases, such as pneumonia. The system leverages deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze X-ray images and predict the presence of abnormalities with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Automatic Chest X-ray Classification**: Detect and classify medical conditions from X-ray images.
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Utilizes CNN architectures such as ResNet, DenseNet, or custom-built networks.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Support for model training on labeled datasets, as well as evaluation on test datasets.
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps and other visualizations are provided to explain the model's decisions.
- **Preprocessing Tools**: Utilities for resizing, normalizing, and augmenting images before feeding them into the model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes labeled chest X-ray images of different medical conditions, most notably from publicly available datasets like:

- [ChestX-ray8 Dataset (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov)
- [CheXpert Dataset](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/)

The images are pre-processed to ensure consistency in dimensions and quality.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture typically includes:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts chest X-ray images as input.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from the images using several convolutional filters.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality while preserving important features.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Classify the features into different categories representing medical conditions.
- **Output Layer**: Predicts the likelihood of each class (healthy or affected by disease).

The models can be fine-tuned or trained from scratch depending on the specific task.

## Requirements

To set up this project locally, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
